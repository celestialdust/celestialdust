## 🎯 Featured Project: Clinical Trial Protocol Copilot

**What I Built**: An AI-powered copilot integrated into Microsoft Word that revolutionizes clinical trial protocol development

**Impact**: 
- ⚡ **40% reduction** in protocol drafting time for all researchers and clinical teams
- 🤖 **100+ protocols processed** through multi-agent orchestration system
- 🔬 **Industrial-standard research capabilities** with PubMed and ClinicalTrial.gov integration

**Tech Stack**: GraphRAG, LangGraph, OpenAI API, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, AWS ElasticSearch, Microsoft Word Add-in

**Why It Matters**: Streamlines the complex, time-consuming process of clinical trial protocol creation while ensuring regulatory compliance and consistency across studies.
